Use context beyond the prompt

Example: A chatbot that answers from your company’s internal PDFs.

LangChain handles: splitting docs → embeddings → vector search → feed into the LLM.

Run multi-step workflows

Example: “Summarize this log file → extract errors → suggest fixes.”

You build a chain to handle these steps automatically.

Enable LLMs to call tools

Example: LLM detects you asked for “top 5 files by size” → calls a shell command → formats the output → replies.
