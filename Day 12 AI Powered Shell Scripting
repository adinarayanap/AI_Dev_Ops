What is Shell Scripting?

A shell script is simply a text file containing a series of commands for a Unix/Linux shell (like bash, zsh, or sh).

Instead of typing commands one by one, you put them in a script and run it as a program.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting backup..."
tar -czf backup.tar.gz /home/user/data
echo "Backup completed!"

Usage:

Automating repetitive tasks

Managing servers (start/stop services, deploy apps)

Backup, monitoring, scheduling jobs with cron

DevOps workflows (CI/CD pipelines, log rotation, health checks)

What is AI-Powered Shell Scripting?

AI-powered shell scripting means using AI (like LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to assist in writing, debugging, or even executing shell scripts.

Instead of writing everything manually, you can:

Generate scripts from natural language

Example: “Write me a script that monitors CPU usage and alerts if >80%” → AI generates the script.

Explain existing scripts in plain English.

Fix errors in scripts automatically.

Dynamic scripts that adapt at runtime by calling AI models (e.g., a script that asks an AI how to handle logs or configuration).

Example: AI-Powered Shell Script
#!/bin/bash
# AI-assisted script to analyze logs

LOGFILE="/var/log/syslog"

# Extract errors
grep "ERROR" $LOGFILE > errors.log

# Ask AI to summarize errors (using Bedrock/Vertex/OpenAI)
SUMMARY=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "Summarize the following errors:"},
          {"role": "user", "content": "'"$(cat errors.log)"'"}
        ]
      }' | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content')

echo "AI Summary of Errors:"
echo "$SUMMARY"
